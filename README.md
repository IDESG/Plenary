Plenary
=======

This GitHub group and repository is operated by [MIT Human Dynamics Lab](http://hd.media.mit.edu) for purposes of research and development related to support of the mission and membership in the NSTIC Identity Ecosystem Steering Group (IDESG) and is not an official activity of the NSTIC IDESG.  The official web page for the NSTIC IDESG is [http://www.idecosystem.org](http://www.idecosystem.org) and the government national program office is [http://www.nist.gov/nstic](http://www.nist.gov/nstic). 

This GitHub repository was set up to provide a forum to explore sandbox, proof of concept or peer-reviewed open innovative ideas for potential later use by or related to the mission of the NSTIC IDESG.  This specific "Plenary" repository relates to the role and functions of the IDESG Plenary and resources developed and published under creative commons license in this repository may be of value or use by other Plenary or similar bodies of other organizations.  

Ideally, if this repository is useful, the IDESG Plenary and Corporation of the IDESG will choose to adopt it as an IDESG resource, in which case MIT would transfer ownership of the repository and/or GitHub organization to the IDESG for use by Plenary and it's entities' conduct of IDESG activities.  

Please pose questions/comments/issues using the [GitHub issues tickets](https://github.com/IDESG/Plenary/issues) (to the right in the virticle menu) and please share back any experiences gleened from or updates for deployment of the materials in this repository.
